_Datach Dragon Ball Z - Gekitou Tenkaichi Budou Kai_: **No Barcode, Variously Optimized**



# Description

## General

- Press buttons to select character. When you need to select character, pressing SELECT will display the character ID. Press the arrow keys to adjust the ID. You can press A to select the character corresponding to the ID, or you can press START to select randomly. When selecting character, the buttons do not distinguish between 1P/2P controllers. The level of the fighter selected by ID is always Lv4. The level of a randomly selected fighter is random, and Lv0 may appear.

- In battle scenes, character level Lv1-Lv4 will be displayed as number 1-4 under the avatar. Lv0 will not be displayed.

- Player can use all skills not higher than their current level. The usage is:
     - AB: Lv1
     - Back + AB: Lv2
     - Front + AB: Lv3
     - Down + AB: Lv4

     _For example, a fighter at Lv3 has the skills of Lv1, Lv2, and Lv3 at the same time, but does not have the skill of Lv4. Pressing "Down + AB" will trigger the skill of Lv1._

- **During battle, both sides can use skills at the same time.**

- After pressing START to enter the PAUSE state during battle, player can press SELECT to cycle through the following three control modes:
     - 1P vs 2P
     - AI vs AI
     - 1P vs AI

- In 4-player/8-player mode, AI vs AI will also enter the battle scene.

- In 8-player mode, after each battle, the winner's various values will be fully recovered.

- In 4-player mode, AI may select Goku, S Goku, Frieza 1-3, and Cell 1-2. In 8-player mode, AI may select Goku and S Goku.

- The settings interface is displayed in English. The default value of the settings has been adjusted.



## Skills

- Android No.17 and No.18 can move after opening their protective shields, and can collide with, step on, and push from below to cause damage.

- In the original version, the damage caused by collision, stepping on people, and pushing from below under special state were too high. They are all halved in this hack.

- Tenshinhan can cast other skills after using Four Body Fist.

- Tenshinhan's Four Body Fist: After using it in the original version, its various values will become 1/4. In this hack version, after using it, the HP/BP will be halved, but the DP will not be reduced.

- Saibaman's self-destruction: Will reduce HP to 1000 after being used in the original version. In this hack version, it can be used multiple times. HP will be halved after each use (minimum reduced to 1000). It cannot be used when HP <= 1000.

- The blood-sucking of Android No.19, Cell 1, and Cell 2: Damage and self-recovery has been increased. And the BP will be restored partially during the blood-sucking process.



## Helpers

- Grandpa of Goku (ID 50): Seal the opponent's skill for one round. If he appears before the opponent's dragon, it will invalidate the opponent's dragon.
